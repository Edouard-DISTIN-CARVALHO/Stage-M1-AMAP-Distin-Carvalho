**Topic:** Primary productivity of leaf litter subjected to fire regimes in the Cerrado biome in Brazil.

*Research Question:* *Under which fire frequency is primary productivity of leaf litter the highest?*
*How have plants adapted to these fire regimes?*

*Hypotheses:* 1) Plants exposed to more frequent fires would have the highest primary productivity. 2) Leaves would show higher primary productivity under frequent fire regimes. 3) The dry season would present the highest productivity rates at higher fire frequencies.

**Project Steps:**

1. Standardization of primary productivity with basal area
2. Study of litter composition
3. Study of primary productivity seasonality
